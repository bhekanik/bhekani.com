            Review this PR for REAL ISSUES and AI CODE SMELLS:

            ## 1. REAL BUGS (must fix)
            - Logic errors, off-by-one, null/undefined access, race conditions
            - Runtime failures: unhandled errors, missing awaits, incorrect async
            - Security: injection, auth bypasses, data exposure
            - Data loss: incorrect mutations, missing boundary validations
            - Breaking changes: API contracts, backwards compatibility

            ## 2. DEAD CODE (important)
            - Unused functions/vars/imports not cleaned up after changes
            - Commented-out code blocks without explanation why kept
            - Old implementations left after refactoring
            - Remnants from removed features

            ## 3. AI TELLTALE SIGNS (flag these)
            Comments:
            - Narrating obvious code behavior ("// loop through array")
            - Repeating what code already says ("// increment counter" above i++)
            - Explaining standard language features

            Over-engineering:
            - Unnecessary abstractions for one-time operations
            - Complex solutions for simple problems
            - Multiple attempts/patches left in code instead of cohesive refactor

            TypeScript smells:
            - Lazy `any` without checking existing types first
            - Unnecessary `as` casting when proper typing works
            - Over-annotated types TS would infer
            - Not using existing library types (@types/*)

            Code style smells:
            - Overly defensive null checks everywhere (when types guarantee)
            - Verbose if/else instead of ternary for simple cases
            - Old for loops instead of forEach/map/filter
            - Not using optional chaining (?.) or nullish coalescing (??)
            - Intermediate variables for simple one-liner operations
            - Not using destructuring/spread when cleaner

            ## IGNORE (linting catches)
            - Style, formatting, naming conventions
            - Import order
            - "Could be cleaner" without concrete problem

            ## OUTPUT
            - Real bugs: file:line, what's wrong, severity
            - Dead code: file:line, what's unused
            - AI smells: file:line, pattern name, suggestion
            - If nothing found: just "LGTM"
            - No filler, no praise, no vague suggestions
