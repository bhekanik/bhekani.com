I'm back on VSCode. I've used neovim for a while. I started on VSCode and once I learnt the vim motions I really wanted to move to neovim but I didn't want to have to deal with the stress of setting it up. Eventually the vim vscode extension started being buggy and freezing and that forced me.

The first time I tried to set everything up myself, you have probably predicted that this didn't go too well. Fortunately, not too long after that I discovered LunarVim. I set that up and I was of to the horses. LunarVim lost it's appeal to me when I got to a place when I needed to customise something. So I switch to NvChad which was a delight. I eventually switched to AstroNvim primarily because of their plugin ecosystem where things are already preconfigered with the common settings. This reminded me of vscode's plugin system. At this point I didn't think I'd change. However, last holiday I figured I'd give vscode another shot since it's been so long and I found that the vim plugin is not so buggy. So I ported over most of my most used key bindings and that's what I'm using now.

Now that I'm back I realise there are some quality of life things I like about vscode that I'd forgotten. Small things like auto import and cleanup of imports. Anyway the rest feels very much like my AstroNvim setup.
