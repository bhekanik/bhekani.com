myReview: This book is written in such an amazing way It really brings that sense of being a child and seeing the world through those eyes The feeling of being in this massive world but only being able to understand it from your limited perspective I still wonder whether all those things actually happened or they were just the boys was of dealing with everything that happened to him brbrIt feels like a fairy tale but with very adult themes It really goes a long way to display the casual cruelty of the adult world and the purity of childhood All told through these fantastic and mystical events I have no better way of saying it But I loved it
