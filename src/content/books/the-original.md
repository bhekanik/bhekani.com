myReview: This was an interesting book not so much for its story exactly but for the questions it put in my mind Had me wondering about identity and what exactly makes me me and all that I think it explores that pretty well Other than that I dont think the story was very engaging and maybe it was intentional but I felt like there was very little going on Maybe I would have loved to explore the world a little more to like it but I doubt it I just finished the cosmere books that are currently published so it was just nice to read a Brandon Sanderson book again thats probably the main reason why I picked it up
