myReview: I really enjoyed this book so much that I couldnt wait to get into book two the magic system is intriguing the action is thrilling and the characters are really fascinating I struggled to even take breaks or work because I was so hooked At no point did I feel bored or anything like that I highly recommend it even if you dont like fantasy try it
