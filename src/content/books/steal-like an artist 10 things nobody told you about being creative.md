myReview: Very simple ideas very clear in how to apply them very practical and completely brilliant It feels like a book he sat down and wrote in one afternoon or one weekend in that its easy to read it doesnt wander or go around in circles it makes its point quick and concisely and moves on to the next But at the same time it still feels like a supercondensed package of real experiences I love it
