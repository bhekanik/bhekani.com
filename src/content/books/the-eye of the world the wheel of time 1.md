myReview: Finally finished this guy I must admit it wasnt easy keeping up with everything that was going on I was definitely more present in the last half than the first It generally takes me a few chapters to get whos who and whats going on when reading these long fantasy books but here I got beyond halfway and I still got confused with the characters a bit It might be because I was taking long breaks in between and getting bored by all the inns I dont like that we never really got many answers but I guess its incentive to continue the series
