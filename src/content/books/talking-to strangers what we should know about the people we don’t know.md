myReview: I struggled to connect with where the book was going at the start so as a result I put it away for a while Then when I picked it up today I immediately caught on and read it through I was captivated the whole way As always Malcolm Gladwells analysis is always captivating and really thought provoking whether you agree with it or not It not only changed the way I view my interactions and perspectives about strangers but also made me reflect on my own personal biases Ill definitely carry these ideas with me and think about them more At the end I really enjoyed this book
