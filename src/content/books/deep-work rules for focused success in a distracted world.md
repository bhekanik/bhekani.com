myReview: "I like Carl Newport and his ideas are generally quite interesting although I find them hard to follow in their entirety. This is definitely something I aspire to and everytime I give it a shot, even part of it, it genuinely makes a real difference."

## What I Disliked

- It's a little impractical sometimes.

## Key Takeaways
