myReview: This was the very first Brandon Sanderson book I read and I absolutely loved it I couldnt stop I read the reviews and some people were saying its not really that great but I really enjoyed it so much that I became a Brandon Sanderson fanboy This was my first fantasy book by the way and it was such a nice and easy introduction its pretty accessible even to people who arent big fans of the fantasy genre
