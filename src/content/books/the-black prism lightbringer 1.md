myReview: I enjoyed this one It took me a relatively short time to get whats going on and get with the story I must say I still dont fully understand how the magic works but maybe thats the intention of the author Ive gotten used to Brandon Sandersons writing where you walk out understanding every little detail of how the magic works brbrThe worldbuilding is cool although I dont have a sense of the full scale of the world I just know about the two main settings hopefully well be introduced to other places in subsequent books in the series This book really is the beginning of the series with all the loose ends it leaves brbrI really enjoyed being in Kips mind and seeing the world from his perspective his battles with his body and weight him thinking hes stupid The trauma from his childhood and having a mother whos an addict him adjusting to his new life and his need to impress and to feel seen brbrWhen I read about the book before reading it everyone was mentioning the authors descriptions of women i thought maybe theyre being too sensitive but no theyre not he really goes into intricate detail when he describes womens features I get that Kip is a teenager and his hormones are raging but nah its a little much brbrIll be jumping straight into book 2
