myReview: I absolutely enjoyed itbrbrIf I were to describe this book in one word Id say resolution All the questions and issues and mysteries raised in the other books are resolved here well not everything everything but a lot The pacing was much improved from book 2 which I felt was a little slow I still think that this is a very accessible book even for people who arent really fans of the fantasy genre
