myReview: I really enjoyed this one it definitely felt slower than book one and had a strong focus on the development of the characters so there were times here and there where I got a little bored and wished to get to some action but even those boring parts were rich and purposeful Lots of nice surprises and plot twists I cant wait to read book 3
