myReview: I really enjoyed this book and I learnt a lot about it I must say though that this is the first parenting book that Ive read to completion so Im not very informed on the subject But yeah I learnt so much and Id highly recommend it to anyone whos got kids or thinking about having kids I cant relate with some of the sections where kids remind you of your own childhood or where you relate in a certain way with them because of your own childhood I should come back to this review when I have kids I guess
