myReview: Overall I enjoyed this book and I enjoyed the series as a whole The characters are amazing Andros Guile is amazing he shines the most for me here Im not entirely sure though how I feel about how things were ended I feel characters grew really well I dont know Im torn I really enjoyed it but theres also something that wasnt so great that I havent yet figured out The magic system was incredible and really well thought out I enjoyed itbrbrSPOILERSbrbr The ending is too happy I hate that It feels like everything just worked out for everyone and I didnt like thatbr I hate that Kip died and came back to life Id have liked it better if he either stayed Alice or stayed deadbr Livs story just went nowherebr The white king just died he wasnt a great big bossbr Android just became a good guy from nowhere that wasnt greatbr The immortals didnt really need to be there in my opinion they didnt do or archive anything really Their presence didnt change much
