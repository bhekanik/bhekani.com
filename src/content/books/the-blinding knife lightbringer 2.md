myReview: I absolutely loved this book I really think Brent Weeks outdid himself on this one I was really drawn in and I could feel all the emotions The one scene that I particularly remember is when Kip had lost his place in the blackguard and Cruxer saves himbrbrIve wanted to be a Blackguard since I could walk I value this brotherhood too highly to let in a man who destroys unity rather than builds it a man who takes money to destroy one of his own If the cost to remove him from the Blackguard is that I too am expelled so be it  Arams the secondbest fighter in our class He took money to finish low He took money to keep Breaker outbrDamn that hit hard brbrI loved it
