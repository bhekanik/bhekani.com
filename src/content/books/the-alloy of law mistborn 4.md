myReview: It was cool nice knowing that the universe continues and to hear some familiar names and identify familiar things from their history It was also great to learn about how the magic system had developed and evolved over the years and see that in a big of a modern setting But I felt like it didnt have the thrill of the first series I wasnt as invested in the characters But I did stay till the end so that counts for something
