myReview: For some reason I had low expectations going into this one and in the first quarter or so of the book I really struggled to maintain focus However when it picked up it really picked up and I was hooked so much that yesterday I slept at 5 am because of it Like everyone else I really like Lightsong every moment spent with him is really interesting and funny I dont think the other characters are very fleshed out though maybe the two princesses I also dont like that I had so many questions at the end dont know if there is a sequel
