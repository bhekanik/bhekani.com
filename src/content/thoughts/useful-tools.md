I came across [MDX Editor](https://mdxeditor.dev/) the today and it looks like something I could potentially find use for one day but I don't have use for it today. I also didn't know where to put things that fall under this categorization so I figured let me just create a list in my blog for things/tools that I might one day want to use. You know those times when you're like I saw a thing that would be perfect for this situation but I've forgotten where I saw it or what it was called. Hopefully when that happens I'll find that I put it here. Anyway, here's the list. 

- [MDX Editor](https://mdxeditor.dev/): React component for writing/editing markdown as if it was rich text so that what you see is what you get. I guess this would be useful if you have none technical people who have to contribute to a markdown blog for example.
- https://github.com/korfuri/awesome-monorepo: A curated list of awesome Monorepo tools, software and architectures. For general knowledge learning about all things to do with monorepos check out [Understanding monorepos](https://monorepo.tools/#understanding-monorepos)
- Ollama now has a [JavaScript library](https://ollama.ai/blog/python-javascript-libraries?ck_subscriber_id=582592156): Get up and running with large language models, locally.
- [React SDK for Video & Audio](https://getstream.io/video/sdk/react/?utm_source=Bytes&utm_medium=promoted_newsletter&utm_content=developer&utm_campaign=newsletter_content_ad&ck_subscriber_id=582592156): If I'm ever going to build Twttter spaces like functionality into a product.
- [One Schema](https://www.oneschema.co/pricing?utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=bytes.dev&utm_campaign=50104279): is a great software for CSV imports with many great tools. This might come in handy for [dealbase](https://dealbase.africa) one day but not now because it's not free. Some alternatives are [Flatfile](https://flatfile.com/). Some open source alternatives are [React CSV Importer](https://github.com/beamworks/react-csv-importer) and [React-importer](https://github.com/czhu12/react-importer).
- [Glaze](https://glaze.dev/): Glaze is an animation framework that combines the power of GSAP and utility-based document authoring Ã  la Tailwind to create a simple, yet powerful, way to compose declarative animations for the web.
