I came across [MDX Editor](https://mdxeditor.dev/) the today and it looks like something I could potentially find use for one day but I don't have use for it today. I also didn't know where to put things that fall under this categorization so I figured let me just create a list in my blog for things/tools that I might one day want to use. You know those times when you're like I saw a thing that would be perfect for this situation but I've forgotten where I saw it or what it was called. Hopefully when that happens I'll find that I put it here. Anyway, here's the list. 

- [MDX Editor](https://mdxeditor.dev/): React component for writing/editing markdown as if it was rich text so that what you see is what you get. I guess this would be useful if you have none technical people who have to contribute to a markdown blog for example.
- https://github.com/korfuri/awesome-monorepo: A curated list of awesome Monorepo tools, software and architectures. For general knowledge learning about all things to do with monorepos check out [Understanding monorepos](https://monorepo.tools/#understanding-monorepos)
