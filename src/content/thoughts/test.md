This is a test of whether I can quickly write articles on my blog by writing a quick markdown file in the github app on mobile.

### Update

It is indeed possible and easy. Just add the file, make sure to add the frontmatter (which is the tedious part) then commit. Vercel will deploy the branch and that's it.
