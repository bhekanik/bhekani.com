    "searchText": "building an llm model router lessons from the wild what we learned building a model router for a multi model ai chat app the scoring approach that didn t scale and the classifier rewrite that fixed it technical ai llm model routing i built blah chat https blah chat mostly for my friends and family it s an ai chat app that gives you access to every major model openai anthropic google perplexity deepseek meta xai and you can switch between them mid conversation the first version had a model picker you d open it see a list of 30 models and choose one i thought this was great my friends and family did not the feedback was unanimous i don t know what any of these mean gpt 5 claude sonnet gemini flash these names carry weight if you re in the ai bubble if you re not they re gibberish so i built a feature i called triage after every message a fast model would read the request look at which model was chosen and if there was a better fit it d nudge the user hey you asked a coding question you might get better results with gpt 5 1 codex people liked it then they said this is useful but it would be great if i didn t have to think about it at all on chatgpt i just get in there and talk fair enough but here s the thing about chatgpt when you re on the free tier they re quietly routing you to their cheapest model i didn t want that for my users i wanted them to not think about model selection _and_ actually get the best model for each task so i needed to build a router that s harder than it sounds the naive approach let the llm decide the first router worked like this 1 send the user s message to a fast cheap llm gpt oss 120b via cerebras 2 ask it to classify the message into one of 8 task categories coding reasoning creative factual analysis conversation multimodal research 3 score every eligible model with a multi dimensional weighted formula 4 pick the winner the classification llm also assessed complexity simple moderate complex whether vision or long context was needed and whether the question was high stakes medical legal financial advice then the scoring engine kicked in the scoring formula looked reasonable on paper base_score category_score model task secondary_category_bonus cost_penalty user_cost_bias speed_bonus user_speed_bias stickiness_bonus if same model as last message reasoning_bonus if task needs thinking research_bonus if perplexity model research task after scoring we d bucket models into cheap mid premium tiers roll a weighted random to pick which tier then select a random model from that tier the weights shifted based on complexity simple tasks weighted toward cheap models complex tasks toward premium it worked for about two weeks why mathematical capability scoring breaks the problem with scoring models is that the scores are lies not intentional lies they re just opinions that ossify into numbers when i first set up the model profiles i gave claude opus 4 a coding score of 98 and gpt 5 a coding score of 92 why those numbers because that s roughly how they felt when i tested them roughly how they felt is a terrible foundation for a routing system that makes thousands of decisions a day the scores drift models get updated silently google pushes a gemini 2 5 flash update that seriously improves its coding ability but the router still thinks it s an 85 meanwhile a model that was genuinely good at creative writing three months ago has been de tuned for safety and now produces bland output but the router still routes creative tasks to it because the score says 95 the weights fight each other instead of stopping to rethink the approach i kept patching the stickiness problem was a good example the clean solution is a simple rule if the route label hasn t changed keep the same model but i was so committed to the scoring approach that i tried to solve it with scores so i bumped the current model s score to weight it higher a user would start with a cheap model for a casual question then ask something complex and the stickiness bonus would keep them on the cheap model because the score bump would outweigh the category score so i d add a decay factor which interacted with the cost penalty which broke something else the same thing happened with model diversity the mathematical model kept giving heavy weight to llama because it s essentially free every message that wasn t explicitly complex would route to llama i didn t want that but instead of asking why the scoring approach kept funnelling everything to one model i tried to inject randomness tier weighted exploration roll the dice sometimes pick a premium model for variety good idea in theory in practice a simple what s 2 2 sometimes gets routed to claude opus 4 15 m input tokens because the random roll landed on the premium tier for a message that should cost 0 00001 paying 100x more for the same output you re asking an llm to reason about model selection this was the real mistake which model should handle this query is a classification problem not a reasoning problem the llm would sometimes over think marking a simple hello as moderate complexity because well greetings can have cultural nuance right my wife is my primary tester she s the person i most want to actually use the things i build one day she asked a serious question and the router doing what it loved to do sent it to llama the answer came back unanchored from reality she looked at me and said see your apps now i should just use chatgpt that stung but it was also clarifying i looked at the scoring system i d built and realized i didn t understand how it worked anymore i couldn t explain why it made the choices it made every fix i d applied had been a patch on a patch and the whole thing had become opaque to its own creator if i can t reason about the system the system can t be reasoned with cost per route 0 000008 latency 250 600ms and the llm classification was wrong 15 20 of the time anyway the rewrite classification policy before rewriting i went looking for how other people solve this there s academic work but almost no production stories routellm uc berkeley anyscale and canva 2024 showed that classification based routing can cut cost by up to 85 on certain benchmarks while maintaining 95 of quality frugalgpt stanford 2023 demonstrated that cascading works try a cheap model first escalate only when needed openrouter presumably has a sophisticated production router but they publish nothing about its internals that made me nervous if routing were as simple as classify and look up wouldn t someone have written about it by now maybe there s secret sauce i m missing maybe the reason nobody publishes is that their routers are all held together with the same duct tape mine was i built the new system anyway but with less confidence than the first time here s what it looks like stage 1 hard deterministic rules before any ml check simple rules image attachments route to vision user says search for or latest news route to research conversation context over 100k tokens route to long_context message matches high stakes patterns medical advice legal questions route to reasoning_complex these fire in 1ms and handle 15 20 of all messages deterministic no llm no embeddings no cost one thing that worries me here capability metadata can rot too a model that supports tool calling today might lose it in an update or a provider might add vision support without us knowing the difference is that a broken hard rule produces an obvious failure this model doesn t support images not a subtly wrong answer obvious failures are easier to catch and fix but it s still a maintenance surface i ll need to watch stage 2 embedding similarity for everything else we embed the user s message and compare it against 120 labeled examples using cosine similarity each example is a short message tagged with a route label the route labels are product trade offs not task types label what it means fast_cheap_chat quick responses minimize cost balanced_general everyday tasks good quality cost ratio code_heavy code generation debugging creative_writing stories copy brainstorming reasoning_complex math logic high stakes decisions research needs web search current information the old router would classify your message as coding and then try to _reason_ about which model is best at coding that s two problems stacked on top of each other first you need an accurate task classification and then you need an accurate scoring of model capabilities every routing decision passes through two layers of uncertainty and errors in either layer compound the new router asks a different question entirely what does this message _need_ classifying something as code_heavy doesn t just describe the task it encodes a product decision this is worth paying for a good coder and here s the ranked list of models we trust for that each label maps to an ordered list of models a bin code_heavy goes to gpt 5 1 codex first then claude sonnet 4 then deepseek r1 fast_cheap_chat goes to gpt 5 nano first then gemini 2 0 flash the embedding comparison uses top k weighted voting k 5 look at the 5 most similar examples aggregate their labels by similarity score pick the winner if the winning label has high enough confidence 82 and enough margin over second place 5 we use it directly cost one text embedding 3 small call 0 000003 latency 50 100ms 60 cheaper 3 5x faster than the llm approach stage 3 llm fallback only when uncertain when the classifier isn t confident maybe the message is genuinely ambiguous between code_heavy and reasoning_complex we fall back to a simplified llm call but instead of the full classification prompt we just say pick one of these 3 labels much simpler much faster this fires about 10 15 of the time in testing stage 4 model bin selection once we have a route label selecting the model is deterministic walk the ordered candidate list filter by capabilities vision long context apply cost speed preferences user s bias settings reorder within the bin check sticky routing keep the same model if the label hasn t changed stage 5 decision trace every routing decision gets a full trace which hard rule matched the top similarity score the route label whether the llm fallback was used embedding latency total latency candidate models considered all stored on the message this is what i wanted most with the old system debugging a bad route meant reading llm reasoning text like this appears to be a moderate complexity coding task with some analytical elements okay but _why_ did it pick gemini flash over gpt 5 1 codex who knows with the new system hard rule none top similarity 0 89 to code_heavy second 0 72 to reasoning_complex margin 0 17 selected gpt 5 1 codex first in bin latency 67ms i can look at that and know exactly what happened and why the feedback loop the old system couldn t learn the new one can when a user gets an auto routed response we capture signals if the generation completes normally that s an implicit positive if they hit regenerate that s an implicit negative if they manually switch the model that s a strong negative and thumbs up down is the obvious explicit signal these feed back into the example database if users consistently regenerate messages routed as balanced_general that should have been code_heavy we add those messages as labeled examples the classifier gets better over time without any code changes right now the promotion from signal to labeled example is manual curation but the infrastructure for automating it is there what we don t know yet i m writing this on the day we merged the new system before it s handled real traffic the code sits behind a feature flag routermode in our admin config defaulting to the legacy scoring system rollout plan run both systems in shadow mode for a week or two logging the classifier s decisions alongside the legacy system s actual decisions compare agreement rate latency cost distribution when i m confident flip the feature flag if something breaks flip it back from the admin dashboard no deploy needed i ll write a follow up with real production data once we have it questions i want answered what s the actual agreement rate between legacy and classifier how often does the llm fallback fire on real traffic does the 60 cost reduction hold up do users regenerate less with the new router which route labels are under represented in seed examples what actually changed we went from a system that cost 0 000008 per route and was wrong 15 20 of the time to one that costs 0 000003 but if i m honest the debuggability matters more than the cost savings the old system produced plausible sounding reasoning for decisions i couldn t verify or act on the new system gives me a similarity score a margin and an ordered candidate list when it makes a bad call i can see the nearest examples spot the gap add a labeled example and move on i know where to look the first time around i was so excited to ship a clever system that i never stopped to ask whether i could understand it i kept patching because admitting the approach was wrong felt like admitting i d wasted the work the thing i actually learned isn t about routing it s that a system you can explain will always beat a system that impresses you clever breaks at 2am and you can t figure out why simple breaks and you fix it in ten minutes and for a product i built for people i care about that s the difference that matters blah is open source https github com b chmlo blah if any of this sounds interesting to work on i d love some contributors"

    "searchText": "confrontation as opportunity embracing difficult conversations for personal and interpersonal growth discover the power of confrontation and how to turn it into an opportunity for growth advice career just reflections in the past i ve often avoided confrontational situations because of my introverted nature the thought of confrontation makes me anxious and i just want the conflict to be over as soon as possible this often leads me to make concessions i shouldn t make and ultimately not stand up for what i believe in i realize that avoiding discomfort at the moment only sets me up for even greater discomfort later on so i have five resolutions this year here s the first one i will not shy away from tough conversations when necessary i will approach confrontation and tough conversations head on i will be resilient disciplined and focused and provide that strength to others have you been in a situation where you needed to have a difficult conversation but just couldn t bring yourself to do it whether it s a conversation with a family member friend or colleague we ve all been there the fear of conflict and the unknown outcome can hold us back from having conversations that could change everything but what if i told you that one conversation could be the key to ending a long standing feud building new connections or advancing your career that s right sometimes all it takes is one conversation to make an enormous impact on our lives and it s not just individuals who struggle with confrontational conversations teams can also suffer when a difficult but important issue goes unaddressed tensions rise trust decreases and collaboration can grind to a halt as part of teams that perform crucial functions such as surgeries running schools or managing people s pensions we can t afford to avoid tough conversations that s why i ve decided to face my fear of confrontational conversations and learn all i can about how to have them effectively and in this article i ll share what i ve learnt with you we ll explore the importance of having tough conversations and discuss practical tips and strategies for navigating tough conversations with grace and empathy so let s jump in and learn how to lead those conversations that could change everything first why is this important confrontation is an opportunity for growth facing difficult conversations head on allows for a safer space in our relationships to grow and helps improve our communication skills it allows us to live a more authentic life we should choose to view confrontational situations as opportunities for growth both personally and in relationships with others helping us to be more resilient disciplined and focused and providing that strength to others while confrontational situations can be difficult facing them head on can teach us to communicate more effectively and find the right words to express ourselves without escalating the situation empowering others embracing responsibility and facing confrontational situations head on doesn t just benefit you personally it also empowers you to help and empower others when you become comfortable with confrontation you are better equipped to defend those who like you before now may be too afraid or powerless to speak up for themselves in situations where there are power imbalances having the confidence to confront the issue head on can be the difference between perpetuating the imbalance and creating a more equitable and just environment for example when a coworker is being mistreated or taken advantage of it s easy to feel helpless and unsure of how to support them however if you have developed the skills and confidence to engage in confrontational conversations you can step in and defend them helping to restore balance and fairness in this way it not only benefits you as an individual but also has a ripple effect that positively impacts those around you think about it when we re honest and transparent about our thoughts and feelings we give others permission to do the same it s like we re the first domino that starts the chain reaction and before we know it others will start to open up as well and the conversation will become more and more productive so don t be afraid to be the first domino you never know what kind of positive impact it could have not just for you but for everyone involved three simple rules here are three simple rules i ve learnt to follow to help me handle confrontation effectively especially if i m the one leading the conversation the first rule also the toughest for me is to move toward the conflict conflict likes to hide everywhere and is always looming in every interaction we have if we continuously avoid it it will pounce on us when we re least prepared to deal with it so the first step is to understand that conflict is not something to be feared or avoided but it is information that should be approached with a positive mindset it can actually provide an opportunity to better understand the situation and find a resolution that works for everyone involved by moving toward the conflict you can diffuse the tension and help to resolve the issue in a calm and effective manner the second rule is to remember that you don t know as much as you think and even if you do it s best to pretend you don t to truly understand the perspectives of others you need to ask questions about their experiences and listen to what they have to say this means truly focusing on what they are saying and avoiding the temptation to interrupt or offer your own opinions before they have finished speaking by truly listening to what others have to say you can gain a better understanding of the situation and the concerns of all parties involved if you approach the conversation with pre baked solutions you might make things worse finally it s important to keep quiet and allow for pauses in the conversation it may take a few seconds for people to respond but it s important not to panic in those moments of silence instead use the pauses as opportunities to drive deeper thought and well contemplated responses rushing in to rescue the conversation from the silence will only disrupt the flow and make it more difficult to achieve a resolution by giving people time to think and respond you can create a safe and supportive environment for everyone involved to share their thoughts and feelings by following these simple rules and approaching hard conversations with a positive mindset you can lead productive and effective discussions that help to resolve issues and build stronger relationships but what if you dread taking that first step of moving towards the conflict here s what i ll be doing to ease myself into it learning to move toward the conflict here are a few tips for someone looking to improve their ability to embrace responsibility and face confrontational situations start with small steps start by practising in low stakes situations like having a difficult conversation with a friend or family member on a subject that s not about your relationship this will help build confidence and prepare you for more challenging situations in the future identify your triggers take note of what makes you uncomfortable about confrontational situations this could be the fear of conflict the fear of hurting someone s feelings or the fear of not being able to express yourself effectively by identifying your triggers you can develop strategies to overcome them prepare yourself take some time to think about what you want to say before engaging in a confrontational situation write down key points practice them in your mind and have a plan for how you want the conversation to go this preparation will help you feel more confident and in control practice active listening during confrontational situations it s important to listen as much as you speak this means giving the other person your full attention asking clarifying questions and repeating back what you ve heard to show that you understand stay calm and focused confrontational situations can be emotional and stressful but it s important to stay calm and focused take deep breaths practice mindfulness and stay present in the moment my mind wonders a lot even mid conversation sometimes so this is also hard for me this will help you stay in control and communicate effectively seek support surround yourself with supportive people who can help you work through your fears and build your confidence consider seeking the guidance of a therapist or coach who can provide additional support and tools for overcoming your challenges practice the more you practice the more comfortable you will become with confrontational situations try to put yourself in these types of situations as often as you can and learn from each experience over time you will become more confident assertive and effective in handling confrontational situations having the conversation is more important than doing it the right way it s easy to get caught up in the thought of doing it the right way and let s be honest what even is the right way to have a tough conversation having the conversation itself is more important than doing it perfectly sure there are definitely guidelines and best practices to follow but at the end of the day the mere act of having the conversation is what truly matters so i m choosing to let go of the fear of not doing it the right way and instead embracing the opportunity to have the conversation at all otherwise i won t do it after all it s better to try and potentially make mistakes than to let the fear of not doing it perfectly hold me back from making a difference and who knows maybe with enough practice i ll even become a pro at having tough conversations but let s not get ahead of ourselves just yet"

    "searchText": "how to never get a job a comprehensive guide to lifelong leisure looking to maintain your blissful state of unemployment or simply seeking a fresh perspective on job hunting you re in luck here are nine unconventional strategies for not getting a job career advice just reflections today s piece was inspired by and borrows from erik davtyan s insightful medium post https medium com erdavtyan how to never get a job a1509fd333d8 his is specifically for software engineers so i figured i d expand it for a more general audience without further ado let s go in the realm of career advice we often encounter a ton of tips and tricks on how to land the perfect job but what if we flipped the script what if instead we explored the art of not getting a job in this guide i ll give you nine easy strategies that can lead you down the path of perpetual unemployment so whether you re looking to maintain your blissful unemployment or you re an oddball who actually wants a job this guide will provide you with a fresh perspective remember sometimes knowing what not to do is just as important as knowing what to do the art of procrastination why rush to send out cvs when there s an entire world of procrastination to explore procrastination is often misunderstood and maligned but it can be an intriguing journey of leisure and pleasure it s not just about delaying tasks it s about immersing yourself in activities that provide immediate gratification and pleasure so put away that cv and try diving into the depths of the internet where an ocean of knowledge and entertainment awaits you could spend hours even days exploring fascinating articles engaging in online debates or getting lost in the labyrinth of social media the internet is a treasure trove of information and amusement that can keep you occupied indefinitely if that s not your jam you could binge watch your favourite shows an activity that has become a cultural phenomenon in the age of streaming services tv series can offer an escape from reality and a chance to immerse yourself in different worlds why focus on your own boring life when you could spend hours even days following the more exciting lives of your favourite characters experiencing their triumphs tragedies and transformations so who needs a job when you can embrace a different way of life one that values leisure and pleasure over productivity and efficiency so put away that cv and embrace the art of procrastination the mystery of the generic cv when you finally decide to break away from the blissful world of procrastination and update your cv it s important to remember one key rule keep it as generic as possible after all who doesn t love a good mystery you learnt that from the tv show remember instead of tailoring your resume to highlight your unique skills experiences and achievements aim for ambiguity this will perfectly optimise you for perpetual unemployment don t list specific technical skills or soft skills stick to vague generic terms that don t provide any specific information about your skills and experiences phrases like hard worker detail oriented problem solver strong communication skills or results driven are perfect these are meaningless fluff on a cv they give absolutely no indication of what you re actually good at leaving potential employers guessing make it a point not to provide examples of tasks where these skills were displayed that might make you attractive we don t want that in the experience section simply list your job titles and the dates you held them but leave out any details about what you actually did in those roles this will ensure that employers are left scratching their heads trying to figure out what you actually bring to the table remember the goal here is to create a resume that is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma employers love a good puzzle right and if they can t figure out what you re good at they can t hire you it s a win win situation so embrace the mystery of the generic cv and watch as the job offers don t roll in the non interview technique if you did your best on the last point but by some unfortunate twist of fate you find yourself scheduled for an interview it s time to deploy the non interview technique this strategy is all about being as unprepared as possible to ensure you maintain your blissful state of unemployment first don t research the company by not knowing anything about the company you ll effectively communicate your fabulous lack of interest and commitment which is sure to send the right signal second don t let interview prep interfere with your regular online debates and doom scrolling you want to maintain the mystery and get surprised by all the questions during the interview and wing it rambling off topic or nonsensical answers are sure to leave your interviewer scratching their head third punctuality is overrated arrive late this not only shows a lack of respect for the interviewer s time but also suggests you re not particularly interested in the job finally a yawn or two during the interview can be a powerful tool in your arsenal if you re feeling particularly daring consider checking your watch or phone frequently during the interview to really drive home your lack of engagement the non interview technique is all about showing that you d really rather be somewhere else and that there are other things that are more important to you than this interview by following these steps you re sure to leave your interviewer with a strong impression the loner lifestyle who needs connections when you ve got solitude if you interact with people too much you might uncover opportunities and get your foot in the door you don t want that embrace the hermit lifestyle and avoid networking opportunities like the plague industry events are a no go these gatherings are typically filled with professionals in your field who are eager to exchange business cards share insights and discuss potential job opportunities so steer clear of industry conferences seminars and networking events instead enjoy the comfort of your own home far away from the hustle and bustle of the professional world social media interactions should be kept to a minimum to maintain your unemployment streak it s best to avoid platforms like linkedin and twitter or at the very least avoid any professional interactions on them stick to vibes remember the fewer people who know you don t have a job the fewer people there are to ruin your unemployment streak with job offers choose the tranquillity of unemployment over the chaos of job hunting forget about networking and start enjoying the peace and quiet of solitude after all who needs connections when you ve got the comfort of your own company the art of giving up in the rare case that you pass the first interview in some miraculous way it s important to master the art of giving up this is not about a lack of capability or potential but rather a strategic move to maintain your blissful state of unemployment during the interview process there are often several stages designed to assess your skills and suitability for the role this could include a technical interview a take home task or a series of problem solving exercises these stages are typically designed to challenge you to push you out of your comfort zone and to see how you perform under pressure you don t want that you prefer the comfort zone and the warm embrace of the familiar so don t hesitate to throw in the towel if you ever feel stuck give up don t try to work through the problem don t ask for clarification and definitely don t attempt to come up with a solution simply throw your hands up and admit defeat this will not only end the interview process quickly but also leave a lasting impression of your commitment to unemployment don t waste your precious free time after all they re not paying you for this time right and let s be honest the actual job pay was probably going to be too low anyway make up an excuse and abandon it you could say you didn t understand the task you didn t have time to complete it or simply that you didn t feel like doing it the art of giving up is all about choosing ease over effort surrender over struggle it s about recognizing when to step back and let go rather than pushing forward and fighting on so that you can return to your own super interesting stress free life who needs the stress of a job when you can enjoy the tranquillity of unemployment the leisure life work is work and leisure is leisure they re two distinct aspects of life and in our quest for perpetual unemployment it s important to keep them separate your work is a job a means to an end it isn t a hobby a passion or a pastime it s something you do to earn a living not something you do for fun or fulfilment so when you re not working it s crucial to use your free time for activities that don t improve your professional skills daydreaming about the future is a leisurely activity that requires little effort but offers a lot of enjoyment it allows you to imagine different possibilities explore various scenarios and even plan your ideal life all without the constraints of reality couple this with inaction and you have the perfect combo to burn away those extra hours remember you re going to work a lot in your future career anyway so why bother now don t even try to contribute to your industry or take on extra tasks you shouldn t do work for other people for free if you re in a team just use what the others have done and never contribute this not only saves you effort but also ensures you don t stand out or attract attention which might lead to job offers the art of ignoring feedback in our pursuit of the blissful state of unemployment we must master the art of ignoring feedback a strategy that promotes stagnation over growth and comfort over change whether it s constructive criticism from a potential employer or well intentioned advice from a friend feedback might provide insights into our strengths and weaknesses offering a roadmap for personal and professional development so we re going to ignore it after all who needs growth and improvement when you can remain blissfully stagnant ignoring feedback is not just about dismissing others opinions it s about embracing a mindset of complacency about choosing comfort over challenge it s about rejecting the opportunity to learn and grow and instead maintaining the status quo it s about keeping those blinders on focusing on the present and ignoring the possibilities of the future so the next time you receive feedback whether it s a critique of your resume a suggestion for improving your interview skills or advice on job hunting strategies be sure to ignore it dismiss it forget it and move on the joy of unreliability in our goal of a life of unemployment it s crucial to cultivate a reputation for unreliability this counterintuitive strategy is all about embracing inconsistency and unpredictability traits that are typically frowned upon in the professional world but are key to maintaining your blissful state of unemployment first make a habit of showing up late whether it s for an interview a meeting or a casual catch up tardiness is a surefire way to communicate your lack of respect for other people s time it sends a clear message that you re not committed or serious traits that employers typically love to avoid second in the world of work deadlines are sacred they ensure projects move forward and that everyone is on the same page but in our quest for unemployment we re going to disregard them by consistently missing deadlines we will demonstrate a lack of responsibility and a disregard for the importance of time management further solidifying our reputation for unreliability third forgetting about commitments is the cherry on top of your unreliability cake whether it s a promise to send an email a commitment to complete a task or an agreement to meet at a certain time forget it that is a sure way to show your lack of reliability it suggests that you re disorganized and untrustworthy traits that are sure to deter potential employers the art of unprofessionalism finally if you really want to nail in your blissful unemployment master the art of unprofessionalism this strategy is all about rejecting the norms and expectations of the professional world and embracing a more casual carefree approach let s talk about attire in the professional world how you dress can say a lot about you it can communicate respect seriousness and commitment so instead of dressing appropriately for interviews or meetings opt for casual inappropriate attire think flip flops for a corporate interview a t shirt for a formal event or even pyjamas for a video call next language is a powerful tool in professional settings always use slang colloquialisms and casual phrases in your interactions this will not only show a lack of professionalism but also suggest a lack of respect for the formalities of the business world so there you have it my foolproof guide on how to never get a job follow these tips and you ll be on the fast track to a lifetime of blissful unemployment but remember if you re one of those oddballs who actually wants to get a job you might want to do the exact opposite of everything i ve just suggested happy job hunting or not"

good at exploring codebases on their own they read package json tsconfig json framework configs test suites they grep for patterns and conventions most of what people put in agents md is already available in the actual source of truth the code itself and unlike a markdown file the code won t rot that architecture overview you wrote three months ago half the file paths are wrong now but the code is always current the discoverable from code test eliminates probably 80 of what i see in most agents md files language conventions the linter config already says that framework patterns the existing code already shows that file structure the agent can literally ls the directory what actually belongs in agents md so between the instruction budget and the discoverability test what s left the bar is the agent needs it on every task and it can t figure it out from the code what survives that filter is surprisingly small use pnpm not npm tooling the agent might guess wrong run make test before submitting commands not discoverable from the code this repo requires python 3 12 constraints that save the agent from debugging cryptic errors don t import from src internal use the public api anti patterns the agent would otherwise walk right into that s roughly it if you need more than 10 lines of explanation for something it probably doesn t belong in the always on file skills the better pattern so where does everything else go into skills skills are on demand context they load when relevant and stay out of the way when they re not your react query patterns that s a skill your architecture guide for the payments module skill the key difference is selectivity say you have a skill called testing strategy md that describes your integration test setup your mocking conventions how you handle database fixtures and which test runner flags to use when the agent is writing a new test it reads that file and follows your patterns when it s updating a readme it never sees it those 80 lines of testing context cost you nothing on tasks where they re irrelevant this is the same principle behind lazy loading in software you don t load your entire application into memory at startup you load the modules you need when you need them context for agents should work the same way bad everything in agents md always loaded agents md 200 lines of conventions patterns architecture better minimal agents md scoped skills loaded on demand agents md 10 lines of universal rules skills react patterns md testing strategy md api conventions md i18n workflow md database migrations md a caveat and where this is heading the paper studied bug fixes and issue resolution on existing codebases it didn t study build me a feature from scratch or refactor this entire module it s possible that richer context files help more in those scenarios we don t know yet but i d bet the direction holds most people today give agents small bounded tasks and a bloated agents md is annoying but survivable the industry is moving toward longer running agentic workflows though background agents that plan and iterate across entire features for minutes at a time in that scenario the agent s own reasoning takes up more and more of the budget your 200 line conventions file doesn t just waste tokens at that point it actively competes with the agent s ability to hold its own plan together what i actually have in my setup my own claude md is opinionated but focused on things that genuinely apply to every task use typescript extreme conciseness minimal blast radius prefer battle tested libraries over custom code specific commit message format everything else lives in skills blah chat https blah chat has a claude skills directory with domain specific skills that load on demand memory architecture patterns api conventions testing approaches deployment workflows it works the agent stays focused costs stay reasonable and the skills don t rot because they re scoped narrowly enough to stay accurate the simple version your agents md is probably too long and it s probably making your agent worse apply the two question filter ruthlessly what survives will fit in ten lines move the rest to skills or delete it entirely let your agent think"

    "searchText": "writing is thinking does writing intimidate you unlock the power of writing as a tool for thinking discover how writing aids in articulating thoughts understanding complex ideas and communicating effectively advice career just reflections import quote from components quote astro when faced with the task of writing many of us are quick to admit i have a wealth of ideas but i struggle to find the right words to express them or i m well versed in my subject but i can t organise my thoughts in a clear and interesting way if you resonate with this you ve come to the right place my consistent writing journey over the past two years has taught me that writing isn t as enigmatic as it seems in reality it s about mastering certain skills many of which you already possess don t misunderstand me writing is indeed challenging but it s not unique in that regard many aspects of life are difficult yet we learn to navigate them proficiently i believe the primary obstacle with writing is our tendency to fixate on the end product of writing neglecting the actual process of writing this issue is further compounded by the widespread belief that writing ability is an innate talent which can serve as a significant deterrent my perspective on writing transformed after reading thinking on paper by v a howard phd and j h barton m a their book introduced me to three key propositions about writing that have significantly demystified the process for me these insights have not only helped me understand writing better but also paved the way for me to hone my writing skills for a variety of practical purposes three propositions about writing in the following sections i will delve into these three propositions writing as meaning making writing as a staged performance and writing as a tool for understanding these concepts have been instrumental in my journey towards mastering the art of writing writing is meaning making at its core writing is an act of thinking it s a process where the writer creates meaning using words and the reader in turn uses those words to reconstruct that meaning let s delve deeper into this concept it s crucial to understand that written communication is rarely perfect and seldom complete when we write we strive to create meaning with words and readers attempt to use those words to recreate that meaning however words even among speakers of the same language don t always convey the full meaning our understanding is limited by our grasp of language which is influenced by many factors including context for instance the phrase stand up might seem straightforward but its meaning can shift dramatically depending on the context it could mean physically rising to your feet or metaphorically standing up against oppression if the context isn t adequately conveyed in the writing the intended meaning may not be fully transmitted there s no guarantee that you ll be able to fully articulate your meaning or that your reader will fully comprehend it the potential for success or failure exists on both ends this realization leads us to an important conclusion the primary goal of writing is not communication but meaning making we use words to translate our innate understanding into tangible meaning on a page this perspective is liberating for two main reasons first it means that everyone can and indeed should write freely and often without the pressure of intending to share our work with others the act of writing serves to articulate our thoughts giving them structure and clarity second it relieves us of the pressure to produce perfect or complete writing our writing is merely a snapshot of our current understanding representing our best attempt at creating meaning from that understanding initially the goal isn t to communicate our ideas as clearly as possible but to transfer our thoughts from our minds to the page this understanding underscores the importance of writing as a tool for personal growth and learning whether or not you intend to publish your work writing can help you clarify your thoughts structure your ideas and learn to articulate them clearly and concisely for maximum impact it s a process of self discovery and self improvement a journey that evolves with each word you put down on paper writing is a staged performance consider this scenario if you were asked to chat with a friend at home about a topic that interests you for five minutes every week you d likely accomplish this with ease each week you might have new insights to share or fresh perspectives on previous discussions now imagine the same task but instead of conversing with a friend you re speaking with oprah on her live tv show suddenly the task seems daunting and you become hypercritical of your words the task becomes challenging even though speaking is second nature to us and we know what we want to say the difference lies in the awareness of an audience particularly one that intimidates us writing follows a similar pattern as a writer the moment you become conscious of a potential audience including your future self writing transforms into a staged performance however it s crucial not to view it as a performance until you re ready for it to be initially writing should be a private activity a means of articulating your thoughts on paper the shift to performance mode occurs when you step back to analyze your work scrutinizing its sound and the clarity of its message writing therefore involves two distinct stages free flowing uninhibited articulation and critical revision of initial thoughts we oscillate between these two states of mind the struggle to articulate and the struggle to communicate however it s essential to keep these stages separate attempting to do both simultaneously will probably be counterproductive this understanding is liberating because it allows me to switch off my audience awareness during the early stages of writing and focus solely on my thoughts and ideas the discovery phase this stage encourages full exploration speculation intuition and imagination when the time is right i transition into communication mode focusing on critiquing and reshaping my work for presentation this separation is vital because the processes of discovery and criticism often disrupt each other they have divergent objectives and require different mental attitudes notably criticism with its ruthless penchant for rejection stands in stark contrast to the exploratory nature of discovery writing is a tool for understanding the primary aim of writing much like reading is to understand it s only after gaining this understanding that we can share it with readers in this context writing serves as a tool for thinking once our thoughts are penned down we have the opportunity to critically evaluate them and compare them with ideas from other sources leading to a more robust and balanced understanding of the subject therefore even if your private notes may seem unintelligible to others or even to your future self their value as thoughtful explorations should not be underestimated this perspective encourages us not to shy away from writing that may never see the light of publication these seemingly throwaway writings play a crucial role in enhancing our understanding and serve as the foundation for successful writing this is not to downplay the importance of writing that communicates effectively instead it underscores the idea that the act of writing itself can pave the way to producing content that communicates well after all editing requires a text to refine quote quote putting articulation before communication also reminds us that whether thinking silently aloud or in writing we do not so much send our thoughts in pursuit of words as use words to pursue our thoughts later by revising the words that first snared our thoughts we may succeed in capturing the understanding of others reference v a howard phd and j h barton m a thinking on paper refine express and actually generate ideas by understanding the processes of the mind writing is thinking as i continue to develop in my writing journey i ve come to appreciate the profound interconnectedness of writing and cognitive processes writing in essence is an externalized form of thinking it s a tool that allows us to articulate our thoughts provide them with structure and clarify them regardless of whether we intend to share them publicly or not once our thoughts are penned down we can easily compare them with ideas from other sources bypassing the limitations of our memory this process fosters a deeper and more robust understanding of the subject at hand it s only after this stage that we should consider writing as a performance critiquing our work with the intention of presenting it to an audience the ability to articulate thoughts clearly and effectively is a potent tool as jordan peterson says if you can think and speak and write you are absolutely deadly nothing can get in your way moreover the ability to formulate coherent arguments and present them effectively can pave the way to success"

strengthens it more than remembering it after 3 hours this is why flashcard apps like anki work they surface facts right before you d forget them maximizing retention 3 associative memory memories don

how to use ssh to sign your git commits easy setup secure commits no fuss technical til why git was not initially designed with strong mechanisms for verifying the authenticity of committers it s surprisingly simple for anyone to impersonate another user by altering their commit author name and email settings for instance by running bash git config user name william henry gates iii git config user email bill microsoft com anyone can misleadingly commit changes under bill gates name this poses a security concern highlighting the necessity for a reliable method to authenticate the true identity behind each commit s author this is where signed commits come in they use cryptographic signatures to confirm that a commit was made by the actual individual it claims to originate from various cryptographic methods such as gpg gnu privacy guard x 509 s mime and ssh can be used for this among these gpg is the most common but it s known to be finicky especially for new users since git 2 34 0 ssh can now be used to sign commits ssh is notably straightforward and is already used in most cases for git s existing verification processes how to implement ssh key signing for git commits creating an ssh key first of all ensure that you have git 2 34 0 or newer installed then configure git with your name and email address as follows bash git config user name your name git config user email your email then generate an ssh key using the following commands bash ssh keygen t ed25519 c your email chmod 600 ssh id_ed25519 chmod 644 ssh id_ed25519 pub now start up the ssh agent and add the ssh key to it you can do that with the following command bash eval ssh agent s ssh add ssh id_ed25519 next create a file containing the ssh public key that will be used for verifying signers bash awk print 3 1 2 ssh id_ed25519 pub ssh allowed_signers you are now ready to sign git commits configure ssh signing in git once you have your ssh key configured you need to tell git to use your ssh key to sign commits we do this by adding some options to the git config as follows bash git config global gpg format ssh git config global user signingkey cat ssh id_ed25519 pub git config global gpg ssh allowedsignersfile ssh allowed_signers git config global commit gpgsign true signing a commit everything is now set up to sign commits all you have to do now is create make changes to a git repository and commit them git will automatically sign the commit using your ssh key you can check that it was signed with the following command bash git log show signature you should see something like bash good git signature for your email with ed25519 key sha256 23paskiasosftzeooa6ap6sstsjxgdgdgqmh7aj os on the bottom of the commit and you can verify that the signed commit was signed by an allowed signer with the following command bash git verify commit commit hash add your public key to github you now need to add your signing key to github so that it will have it in its known signers file for verification head over to user profile settings ssh and gpg keys click the new ssh key button give your new key a title then under key type select signing key then run bash cat ssh id_ed25519 pub pbcopy this will copy your publish ssh key into your clipboard paste it into the key section click add ssh key and you should be ready to go bonus if you already have an unsigned commit that you want to sign you can use bash git commit amend no edit s git verify commit v head this will amend the last commit and then verify that it is signed and for signing multiple commits in a branch you can use bash git rebase exec git commit amend no edit n s i branch updates error couldn t find key in agent if you encounter the error error couldn t find key in agent fatal failed to write commit object it typically indicates that git cannot access your ssh key through the ssh agent this might be because the ssh agent is not running or because your ssh key has not been added to the agent to resolve this issue and avoid having to manually start the ssh agent and add your key every time you can automate these steps here s how you can do it for different operating systems for linux and macos 1 automatically start ssh agent and add ssh key on session start you can add commands to your shell s startup file e g bashrc bash_profile zshrc etc to automatically start the ssh agent and add your ssh key when you open a terminal 2 edit your shell s startup file open your terminal and edit your shell s startup file for example if you re using bash you edit bashrc or bash_profile if you re using zsh you edit zshrc 3 add the following script bash start the ssh agent and add your key if z ssh_auth_sock then eval ssh agent s ssh add ssh id_ed25519 fi this script checks if the ssh agent is running by checking if ssh_auth_sock is set if it s not running it starts the ssh agent and adds your ssh key 4 reload your shell configuration apply the changes by running source bashrc or the appropriate file for your shell for windows 1 using ssh agent service on windows you can use the ssh agent service which is available in windows 10 and later this service can be set to start automatically 2 enable and start ssh agent automatically open a powershell window as administrator run the following commands to set the ssh agent service to start automatically and then start it powershell set service ssh agent startuptype automatic start service ssh agent after enabling the service you need to add your ssh key to the agent once using powershell ssh add ssh id_rsa by setting up your system as described your ssh agent will automatically start and load your ssh key when you start a new session which should prevent the error from occurring when you commit changes using git"

rides come to mind i ve sometimes responded to these hugely uncomfortable situations by removing myself or putting on headphones that aren t playing anything just to signal that i don t want to be a part of this given how liberally i talk about this i ve had more than a few people reprimand me for being antisocial or trying to encourage me to talk to people more and to stop being rude i ve gotten questions like what s the matter with small talk are you shy do you hate people these are questions that introverts deal with every day we are painfully misunderstood even the oxford dictionary butchers the definition of introvert and defines us as being shy quote quote introvert n noun introvert plural noun introverts n n ntr v t n n a shy reticent person n n psychology n n a person predominantly concerned with their own thoughts and feelings rather than with external things n n adjective n n adjective introvert n n ntr v t n n another term for introverted so today i want to talk about this strange person called an introvert what goes on in our minds why are we the way we are and specifically why do we hate small talk introverts vs extroverts i m an introvert yet i speak in public a lot and i really enjoy it i give my opinion in open forums and in many spaces you might find me speaking more and louder than anyone else in the room this is only surprising to people who don t understand introversion and confuse it with shyness i m not shy at all that said when i m in social spaces that have people i don t know i blend into the background many people see this and think i have little to say i have lots to say but if in that situation you ask me to mingle with the crowd and make small talk with some random people i would absolutely dread it i d rather leave than do that it would honestly be a little terrifying to me but if you ask me to get up in front of all those people on a stage and lead a discussion for three hours i d be really excited and i can do that almost effortlessly again this is only surprising if you confuse introversion with shyness there s a statement that jerry seinfeld made about being a comedian that explains really well what it s like to be a non shy introvert i can talk to all of you but i can t talk to any of you jerry seinfeld of course there are shy introverts just like there are shy extroverts these two things are not related introverts like anyone else can find socialising fun but while parties and big gatherings leave extroverts energised introverts need to recharge after some time away from everyone being an introvert means you draw energy from being quiet and from being alone with your thoughts and your imagination you like silence you like to sit in solitude and think interacting with people drains you after a while and you need to retreat to your space that doesn t mean that you hate interacting with people and you d rather live alone in the mountains somewhere although there s a part of me that finds that quite appealing it means that you have a limited supply of interacting energy each day so you re very circumspect about how you use it for example you d rather use it on one three hour long deep conversation with a friend than on many small talk exchanges with strangers extroverts draw energy from interacting with people they feel most at home when they re mingling and chatting i have many friends who are like that a few years ago i shared a house with a friend who was like that gary was the prototype extrovert he always had something to say and always wanted to fill the silence with some sort of conversation he enjoyed talking to strangers and would make friends everywhere gary could take a walk outside and come back telling me i met a guy there who also likes basketball in fact his brother plays for the provincial team and i m watching the game with him on tuesday and i d be like you were gone for 23 minutes and you already have a sports date with a stranger how why that s completely foreign to me it would never happen to me but it happened to him all the time i learnt that i m an introvert in my late teens understanding that there s nothing wrong with me was incredibly liberating now i m deeply grateful for how i am and i lean into my strengths as an introvert i listen patiently and make my words matter i rarely speak without considering what i ll say so my words are usually very thought out and i love spending time alone or sitting quietly on my own even in busy places it gives me time to reflect listen to my thoughts and recharge then after that i am ready to reconnect and interact with everyone again i still like the intensity and chaos of loud spaces and big social gatherings but it s in quiet places and small deep intimate conversations where i feel truly at home none of this is to demonise extroversion i respect extroverts and i really enjoy relationships with them i also think i understand them but i don t think that the extroverted approach is the only acceptable way of living even though our society is structured that way the idea that it s rude or wrong to not be sociable all the time is quite ridiculous and infeasible for introverted people everyone is different given this background here s why we introverts hate small talk 3 reasons introverts hate small talk it feels insincere as introverts we have a small tank of interaction fuel and we really don t want to burn it on an insincere conversation therefore we hate insincere conversations we re bad at it and we have no interest in it we don t like to talk to someone whom we know isn t really interested in the discussion if the conversation is about the weather or the traffic or some other banal thing then we have the impression that you re not really interested in that conversation because we re also not interested in that conversation it s just a filler for the silence and we don t mind the silence our finite amount of interaction energy is being wasted on this exchange that is of no interest to either of us so we d rather have silence despite popular belief we don t hate talking we enjoy conversation but it has to be a meaningful conversation we want to get to know the other person hear their thoughts and feelings and get an insight into who they are and what matters to them that will not happen through small talk that neither of us cares about so we shut down the same thing can happen in a non small talk conversation if we re having what we believe is a meaningful discussion then we look at you and while sharing our perspective we look at you and see disinterest then we shut down not that we re offended or anything like that but we don t want to have the discussion anymore because it s pointless if you re not present one thing i ve heard a lot is that you need small talk to help you transition into deeper subjects well this is another case where extroverts want to impose how they work on everyone as introverts we re perfectly happy diving directly into the deep subject we prefer that small talk just impedes more meaningful interactions finally if we re in an environment where no meaningful discussion could occur maybe there isn t enough time like in an elevator or there s too much distraction then we re happy just staying silent we are in our heads all the time we are constantly lost in our heads thinking about many things sometimes we like to plan the next conversation while we are in there thinking and imagining or we re thinking about many things god the news thermodynamics cats like i said many things so if you re taking us out of that we prefer it if you have a good reason sure we understand you meant nothing by the small talk in fact you were probably trying to be friendly but we see friendliness in different ways to us the friendly thing is to not say anything if there s nothing meaningful to say and let people continue to be engaged with whatever is going on in their minds you re trying to be friendly by making conversation about the weather but we re being friendly by not bothering you because we have nothing meaningful to say neither of these is right or wrong you re being who you are and we re being who we are we re very analytical about interactions as i ve said already we re in our heads a lot one consequence of that is that we analyse things a lot we especially analyse our interactions with other people so we will leave every small talk interaction analysing our performance in the exchange giving ourselves a grade usually a poor grade for how we handled it the extrovert will probably leave and just continue with his day and not think about it anymore you may think it s quite exhausting to continuously think about interactions like that you re right it s exhausting and we would rather not do it we prefer to avoid what to us is a high pressure situation that will linger long and lead to very tough self analysis so while silence may be painful to you as an extrovert it s not painful to us the pain for us starts when you break that silence and that s another difference between introverts and extroverts again neither of these is right or wrong you re being who you are and we re being who we are all this doesn t mean that we will avoid small talk all the time it s a necessary evil in our society in our jobs on the dating scene etc we understand that but the main thing i am communicating is that it s work for us it takes effort it s exhausting and we don t like it because it doesn t come naturally to us imagine how you would feel as an extrovert if you were forced to sit alone in a quiet room for an hour with no one to talk to and nothing to do i can do that with relative ease as an introvert because i ll just retreat into my mind but you would likely feel a lot of discomfort and an immense desire to get out of that situation and get back into your natural environment that s how we feel during small talk hopefully this helps everyone out there understand the rest of us humans who aren t extroverts in this highly extroverted world i highly recommend that you check out susan cain s ted talk about the power of introverts https www youtube com

    "searchText": "why i built ai that forgets a tampa trip story my ai remembered i was going to tampa then it forgot which day i was going to the beach the problem wasn t too little memory it was too much all equally prioritized ai memory product blah chat i was planning a trip to tampa last month i told my ai assistant about it which hotels i was considering what i wanted to do when i d be there over the next few weeks the magic happened i d be talking about something completely unrelated and the ai would naturally reference my tampa plans oh you could read that book on the flight to tampa that restaurant sounds like the kind of place you d want to try while you re in tampa it felt like talking to someone who actually knew me then one day i asked which day am i planning to go to the beach on my tampa trip the response oh you re going to tampa that s exciting let me research some beaches for you all the magic gone in an instant the problem wasn t missing memory the strange thing the ai had memories about my tampa trip i could see them in the database dozens of entries about hotels beaches dates activities but when i asked which day i d planned for the beach it couldn t find the right one it knew i was going to tampa that came up in the search but not the specific plan i d made the problem wasn t that memory was missing the problem was that every memory had equal priority how ai memory works and fails most ai memory systems including the one i d built for blah chat https blah chat work like this 1 store everything you talk about 2 when you ask a question do vector search for relevant memories 3 return the most semantically similar ones the only way memories are prioritized is by relevance score how closely the embedding matches your query here s the problem with that consider these two memories memory a from yesterday beach day is thursday confirmed with sarah 10am meet at hotel memory b from 3 weeks ago we should definitely go to the beach while in tampa maybe thursday when i ask which day is the beach both memories mention beach and thursday they have nearly identical semantic relevance vector search sees them as equally good matches but one is a confirmed plan from yesterday the other is a passing thought from weeks ago standard rag can t tell the difference it only knows both mention beach thursday what it s missing recency yesterday vs three weeks ago importance confirmed plan vs casual maybe access patterns i ve referenced the thursday plan five times since making it even with identical semantic relevance these should rank completely differently but they don t because the only lever is similarity score that s not how your brain works how human memory actually works your brain doesn t treat all memories equally it 1 fades unimportant things trivial details decay quickly if you don t use them they disappear 2 strengthens important things every time you recall something it gets stronger your brain is literally saying this matters keep it 3 adapts to what s relevant now the beach day you planned yesterday is more accessible than beach thoughts from last month even if the words are identical this isn t a bug it s optimization your brain has limited resources remembering everything equally would make it impossible to think neuroscientist blake richards puts it plainly the goal of memory is not to transmit the most accurate information over time but to guide intelligent decision making perfect memory isn t the goal useful memory is why just add more context doesn t work the obvious fix dump more memories into the context window if 5 memories aren t enough try 20 or 50 i tried this it made things worse more context meant slower responses more tokens to process higher costs paying for irrelevant context worse reasoning ai drowning in noise and fundamentally it didn t solve the problem the tampa beach day was still buried among 50 other memories all treated equally adding more memories is like trying to remember something by reading your entire diary you need curation not volume the research forgetting is a feature i went looking for solutions and found research that changed how i think about memory popov et al 2019 forgetting is a feature not a bug intentionally forgetting some things helps us remember others by freeing up working memory resources their finding when your brain forgets irrelevant things it frees up resources for what actually matters richards frankland 2017 the persistence and transience of memory their argument memory isn t about perfect recall it s about making good decisions in a changing world forgetting outdated information is adaptive the pattern was clear forgetting makes you smarter not dumber what i built instead i rebuilt blah chat s memory system around three principles 1 memories decay over time unimportant things fade important things persist i implemented ebbinghaus forgetting curves the exponential decay discovered in 1885 each memory has a retention score that drops over time but the decay isn t uniform important memories decay slower your trip dates vs random beach thoughts procedural memories don t decay at all your coffee preferences are stable episodic memories fade faster what you had for lunch last tuesday is gone 2 retrieval strengthens memory every time you access a memory it gets stronger this is spaced repetition the technique used by anki and supermemo but instead of flashcards it s automatic when the ai recalls your tampa beach day to answer your question that memory s stability increases it s more likely to surface next time trivial memories that never get accessed they fade away 3 related memories link together when two memories are accessed together they link if i ask about the tampa trip and the ai recalls both beach day on thursday and hotel checkout friday morning those memories link next time i think about checkout time the beach day surfaces too just like your brain s associative memory the results i tested the new system with the tampa scenario before static memory query which day is the beach top result we should go to the beach maybe thursday 3 weeks old my actual plan beach day thursday confirmed with sarah buried at 8 both mention beach and thursday nearly identical semantic relevance only difference in scoring slight word match variation after cognitive memory query which day is the beach top result beach day thursday confirmed with sarah runner up hotel checkout friday morning linked memory old maybe thursday thought ranked 12 faded naturally why the ranking changed despite similar semantic relevance recent 1 day vs old 21 days 2x retention difference high importance 0 9 vs low 0 3 3x boost accessed twice vs never stability 0 5 vs 0 3 final score 8 2x higher despite same relevance the magic came back but now it was reliable magic here s the key insight semantic similarity alone can t distinguish between a passing thought and a confirmed plan you need recency importance and access patterns working together why this matters for your ai projects if you re building anything with ai memory here s what i learned don t optimize for total recall optimize for relevant recall use decay curves old information shouldn t compete with new information at equal priority strengthen on access when the ai uses a memory successfully make it easier to find next time link related memories context isn t just semantic similarity it s what you ve accessed together let things fade forgetting isn t failure it s cleanup the human brain has had millions of years to figure this out we should learn from it the technical implementation if you want to implement this yourself i open sourced the system npm package blah chat cognitive memory key features ebbinghaus decay curves configurable by memory type automatic retrieval strengthening associative memory graph adapter pattern works with postgres convex etc the core formula is simple typescript retention math exp days stability importance base_decay where days time since last access stability grows each time you retrieve it importance how significant the memory is base_decay 30 days episodic 90 days semantic procedural technical deep dive here https bhekani com posts cognitive memory for ai agents what changed for users the difference is subtle but profound before my ai has a huge memory but can t find what i need after my ai remembers what actually matters conversations feel more natural the ai doesn t just search for keywords it knows what you talked about recently what you ve emphasized what s connected to what it s not perfect memory it s intelligent memory the bigger picture we re at an inflection point with ai everyone s racing to add more context bigger windows infinite memory but that s the wrong direction the limiting factor isn t memory capacity it s memory quality an ai with 1 million tokens of context is useless if it can t prioritize what matters the solution isn t remembering more it s remembering better that means forgetting the irrelevant strengthening the important adapting as contexts change your brain already does this your ai should too try it blah chat now uses cognitive memory by default every new conversation benefits from memories that fade naturally automatic retrieval strengthening associative linking you don t have to think about it it just works the tampa beach day problem solved not because the ai has perfect memory but because it has smart memory memory that knows what matters what s recent and what s worth keeping try it blah chat https blah chat build it npm install blah chat cognitive memory https www npmjs com package blah chat cognitive memory building ai that thinks like you do means building ai that forgets like you do that s not a limitation it s the whole point"
